<!-- The goal of this page was to provide a layout for a resume or CV. The use of a personal website as a resume/CV is ideal as it can be difficult
to fit one's experience and background into the formats generic websites provide. I would like to build off of this in the futre and actually fill
out the sections formally. -->
