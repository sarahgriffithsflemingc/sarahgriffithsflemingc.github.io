<p>This map shows the location of Shark Spotters along the False Bay coastline in South Africa, 
as well as all reported white shark sightings between September 8, 2012, and February 22, 2013. Shark Spotters are 
positioned at strategic points along the Cape Peninsula. A spotter is placed on the mountain with polarised sunglasses 
and binoculars. This spotter is in radio contact with another spotter on the beach. If a shark is seen along the beach, 
the spotter sounds a siren and raises a specific color-coded flag, upon which swimmers are requested to leave the water. 
</p>
<p>
Zoom into the bay to view the various shark siting locations. The red marker denotes permanent sitings and the purple temporary.
 A walking path for shark siting is depicted for safe viewing.
