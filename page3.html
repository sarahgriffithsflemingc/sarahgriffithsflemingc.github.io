<h3 class="dissheading"> Abstract </h3>
<p class="disstext">Commensals are synanthropic animal species that utilize the modified or constructed environment of human habitations for living space or food. Archaeological studies on commensal species can inform how sites were used, indicate abandonment and provide needed contributions to biogeographical studies of modern distributions, abundance of species and conservation of species in rapid decline. Zooarchaeological discussions of Roman Britain are largely focused on the diet and economies of the past. Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum) is one of six Roman towns in Britain that is unpopulated today and the spatial and temporal characteristics of the town’s abandonment is not fully understood. By detailed assessment of the faunal assemblage of Insula III and comparison to other assemblages at Silchester and other large Roman towns, it was found that commensal community varies between towns and calls for more careful identification and assessment of small animals and birds. However, the presence of black rat, wood mice and house sparrows at Silchester indicated continued occupation and trade into the 4th century A.D., indicating the value these small mammals have in future zooarchaeological research.

<h3 class="dissheading"> Introduction </h3>
<p class="disstext">The arrival of the Romans in Britain has been argued to be contemporaneous with the arrival of urbanism, one of the many introductions influenced by or enacted by the Roman increase in territory and area of influence (O’Connor, 1992: 109). Whether established on a pre-existing nucleating site (oppidum) or built on new ground, each occurrence of urbanism was unique (Jones, 1991) and would have been a significant change to landscape and life in Britain.
Silchester was first the site of a late first century B.C. Iron Age oppidum, rapidly developed (Fulford, 2000: 546) and called Calleva (‘woody place’) in what is now Hampshire (Fig. 1.1). An important Iron Age trading centre (Fulford, 2000: 550), a Roman ‘urban’ space was established in mid-first century A.D. Calleva Atrebatum, as it was called, was a civitas capital that retained its significant as a trade centre that housed industry and luxury (Boon, 1974) situated between the Upper and Lower Thames and the Wessex chalklands (Cunliffe, 2012). 
With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, urbanism was thought to have toppled as settlement reverted back to the pre-Roman, rural lifestyle (Jones, 1991). However, recent studies of this Post-Roman - early Anglo-Saxon period have contended this view, highlighting that sub-Roman activity did occur with a continuity of occupation and activity to some extent. Whether this activity can be classified as truly ‘urban’ is debated.
Of all Romano-British towns, six were never repopulated (Clarke & Fulford, 1997). Silchester is one such town, which presented archaeologists a chance to explore the changing nature of occupation from early life to urban decay (Clarke & Fulford, 1997). Despite the Victorian excavations of 1890 and 1909, it has been possible to trace Silchester’s occupation and life from the late Iron Age through to the later Roman periods, with recent work at Insula IX suggesting possible occupation and activity from the 5th-7th centuries A.D. (Fulford, 2006). The scope of this activity is not yet fully understood.
Zooarchaeology has shown itself to be able to provide insight on many aspects of human society, including social structure and economy. The bulk of discussions involve domestic or hunted wild species (Reitz & Wing, 2008: 28); however, this distinction neglects species that occupy the liminal space in between: commensals (O’Connor, 2010).
Ecologists define commensalism as a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits and the other is neither benefitted nor harmed (Cain et al., 2014: 339). Commensal species tend to be small animals, birds, and herpetofauna that come to human settlements for benefits in food, shelter, reproduction and reduced predation. This relationship allows for these species to indicate use and abandonment of sites as their presence is dependent on humans whose actions influence arrival and survival (O’Connor, 2003: 196). This area of research is underrepresented, however. The neglect to study these species in earlier zooarchaeological assessments was, in part, due to recovery methods; however, this neglect continues and encompasses the greater academic sphere (O’Connor, 2013). As such, we have little evidence to understand how development and abandonment of Britain in the Roman period affected the ecology of towns (O’Connor, 2010: 132), neglecting a potential source of insight into urban life through the Roman and into post-Roman periods.

<h3 class="silheading"> Silchester Life Project </h3>
<p class="siltext"> This research compliments the themes of the Silchester ‘Town Life’ project in that it seeks to provide new insight 
into life over time in the town by exploring urban ecology through commensal species and reinforces the need for further research in this 
area not only to expand archaeological knowledge but for its implications on human ecology today.
